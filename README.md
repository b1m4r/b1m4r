### ðŸ“‚ Projects

#### Babycycle E-commerce Backend
- **Background**:  
  The idea behind **Babycycle** stems from the growing environmental concerns related to the overproduction of goods and the culture of consumerism. With the continuous production of new items, the planet suffers from rising emissions and resource depletion. The Babycycle project aims to address this issue by promoting the reuse of baby items that are still in good condition, but no longer used. Instead of buying new products, parents can sell or exchange their second-hand baby products on the platform, helping to reduce waste and decrease carbon emissions.

- **Description**:  
  I developed the backend for **Babycycle**, an e-commerce platform for buying and selling used baby items. Using **Flask** and **SQLAlchemy**, I designed the entity relationship diagrams (ERD), implemented RESTful APIs, and ensured the system was able to handle various operations like user registration, item listing, and transactions securely. The goal was to create a platform where parents can reduce waste, save money, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

- **Technologies**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQL
- **Link**: [Babycycle E-commerce Backend](https://github.com/Group-D-Revou-Final-Project/babycycle-backend.git)

- **My Role & Responsibilities**:
  - **Designed Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**: Visualized the data structures and established relationships between entities in the e-commerce database, enhancing the clarity of the database schema for the development team.
  - **Developed Data Models with ORM**: Used **Flask-SQLAlchemy** to create data models, establishing relationships between entities and improving the efficiency of data management and queries.
  - **Developed RESTful APIs**: Implemented RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend of the e-commerce platform, ensuring smooth data exchange and enhancing system performance.
  - **Collaboration with Frontend Developers**: Worked closely with the frontend team to integrate the backend APIs, ensuring a seamless data flow and providing support for user interaction and experience.
